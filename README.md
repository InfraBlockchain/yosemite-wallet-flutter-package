# Yosemite Wallet Flutter Plugin

This project's goal is to provide wallet feature on [Yosemite Blockchain](https://yosemitex.com)

The plugin lets Flutter developers use blockchain related cryptograhpic operations on both iOS(Secure Enclave) and Android including managing keys and signing transactions.

The wallet is already used on [Yosemite Card](https://yosemitecardx.com) app to securely store cryptograhpic keys and sign transactions when blockchain action is performed.
